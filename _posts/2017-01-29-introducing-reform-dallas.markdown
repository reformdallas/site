For half a century and more, the City of Dallas has been plagued with insider deals which enriched the few and starved the many. Communities have been sacrificed, children left hungry, and a city starved of her vitality. That time is behind us.

We have watched with growing disgust as evidence has mounted against one elected official, public figure and developer after another which clearly shows a pattern of graft, misdeeds and in many cases, criminal conspiracy. That time is behind us as well.

A growing segment of our citizenry has said, "enough". None of these things happen completely in the dark. All that has been missing is a mechanism for those who see what is happening to tell others, and the light of day will flood into the dark corners where such deals are struck. That time is here. 

If you see something, say something. Think of this site as a public trust. A repository of information. Anything that comes into our hands will be tagged so as to be searchable, and posted in our public database. All material is freely available for ANY citizen to read, download, share, question.

* Have FOIA data? Share it here.
* Can’t believe the illegality of the contents of the email you are reading? Forward it to **admin@reformdallas.org**.
* Have something so sensitive it needs to be uploaded anonymously? We will send you the encryption keys you need to protect your anonymity.
* Have evidence so damning it can only be passed via thumb drive? We have that covered.

We will cover all subjects, peer into every department, and analyze every contract and every council vote we can. That being said, it takes data. When we share data we geometrically advance the power of the light. We learn of connections we never knew existed, links that then make the next leap possible. Perhaps most importantly, we learn there are others like us. There are others with pieces to the puzzle, others who have documents, others who have simply said, "enough".

So what are we interested in? We’re glad you asked.

* City contracts? Of course
* Park Board malfeasance? Naturally
* Toll road? Oh my, yes
* Sweetheart developer deals? Bring em on
* South Dallas graft? Check
* Skimming of grant money intended for our poor/homeless? Please
* Fair Park Board? Do you even have to ask?
* Dallas Citizens Council? I think you hear us knocking

There’s no limit to our thirst for data. We want to know everything, because we want our citizens to know everything. We take no position on the issues. We back no candidate.
Rather we oppose those candidates who would sell our city short for their thirty pieces of silver. We have no agenda beyond transparency. Transparency cures all. The data wants
to be free.

If you want to help expose the darkness, contact us.

If you are one of the shady operators stealing from the citizens of Dallas,

We are here. And we are coming for you.
